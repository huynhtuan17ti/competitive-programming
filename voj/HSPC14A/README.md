Do the opposite operator:  
- $(a, b) \rightarrow (a-b, b)$  
- $(a, b) \rightarrow (a, b-a)$  

Obviously, the above inference is similar to find GCD problem (Euler's theorem).  
So for every $N$, find the integer $X$ which $gcd(X, Y)$ equal to $1$ and find the number of steps through finding GCD.
